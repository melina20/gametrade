# Gametrade
PHP MVC framework

Gametrade is a dynamic web application that uses OOP (Object Oriented Programming) principles. The main idea for the application
was to create an online web application trading of videogames between the users. Each user in order to make an exchange, should have
its own profile. In the user's profile besides the information that he has(name, username, gender, age etc.), there will be two
options:

- "I want a game"
- "I want to offer a game"

## Here is a small description of the application: ##

  user that the first user wants one of his games. The second user decides if he wants an offered game that belongs to the first user. If he accepts the offer the system sends a notification to both of the users that they can trade their games.
- A user may rate another user if he has trade a game with him. The user may give feedback for other users with stars or comments
